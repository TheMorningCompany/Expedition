## What it is

Expedition is a minimalist web browser with advanced gesture control, letting users find what they need as fast as possible. We are focused on creating an outstanding user experience and interface.


## How to Use

Expedition has advanced gesture control for almost every action. A swipe left on the searchbar shows bookmarks and history (under development), right shows tabs, down is reload and also switches back to the mobile website after a swipe up goes to the desktop version. Swipe between websites to go back and forth. Three finger tap to share the link.
